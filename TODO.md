# TODO - Harmonize h2 and p font sizes across CSS files

## Plan:
1. Update contact.css - standardize h2 to 46px and p to 18px (desktop)
2. Update services.css - standardize h2 to 46px and p to 18px (desktop)
3. Update gallery.css - standardize p to 18px (desktop)

## Note:
- Keep all responsive/@media rules unchanged as per user request
- Only modify desktop/base styles
